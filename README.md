## Dependencies

- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/mwit30-8/MVIS.git
   cd MVIS
   ```

2. Run DGraph locally at <http://localhost:8080/graphql>

   1. Change directory to `/backend`

      ```sh
      cd backend
      ```

   2. Build and run

      ```sh
      docker-compose build # Build docker images
      docker-compose up # Run DGraph
      # or
      docker-compose up --build # Build and Run docker images
      ```

      Use `-d` flag to run in background.

3. Deploy graphql schema and lambda script

   1. Change directory to `/backend`

      ```sh
      cd backend
      ```

   2. Set environmental variable

      - `AUTH0_CLIENT_ID` and `AUTH0_URL`

      You may define the variable in `/backend/.env`.

      If you are deploying to DGraph Cloud, there are additional variables to be set.

      - `CEREBRO_JWT` or both `CEREBRO_EMAIL` and `CEREBRO_PASSWORD`
      - `DEPLOYMENT_NAME`

   3. Build and deploy

      ```sh
      yarn build # deploy to local DGraph
      ```

      or

      ```sh
      yarn deploy # deploy to DGraph Cloud
      ```

4. Run frontend application

   1. Change directory to `/frontend`

      ```sh
      cd frontend
      ```

   2. Set environmental variable

      - `AUTH0_CLIENT_ID` and `AUTH0_DOMAIN`
      - `BACKEND_URL` (Usually <http://localhost:8080/graphql> for local DGraph)
      - `BACKEND_API_KEY` (may be required by DGraph Cloud)

      You may define the variable in `/frontend/.env`.

   3. Build graphql code

      This must be re-run every time the schema, queries, and/or mutations change.

      ```sh
      yarn codegen
      ```

   4. Run Expo dev client

      This will automatically watches over changes in `/frontend/src`.

      ```sh
      yarn start
      ```
